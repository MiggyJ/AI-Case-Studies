# Artificial Intelligence Coursework Repository

This repository contains the code and data for my coursework on Artificial Intelligence, completed as part of my college curriculum. The project covers various aspects of AI, such as web scraping, data preparation, clustering, classification, and a final project that applies machine learning techniques.

## Folders

### Web Scraping

The `Web Scraping` folder includes Python scripts to extract data from various websites. The data collected is used for analysis and modeling.

### Data Preparation

The `Data Preparation` folder includes Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. The data is prepared for analysis and modeling in the following steps.

### Clustering

The `Clustering` folder includes Python scripts for clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. These algorithms are used to find patterns in data and group similar data points together.

### Classification

The `Classification` folder includes Python scripts for classification algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. These algorithms are used to predict the class or category of data based on input features.

### Final Project

The `Final Project` folder includes code and data related to building a machine learning model to predict a certain outcome. The project is a culmination of all the previous phases, and it involves applying the learned techniques to real-world data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, it is recommended to install Conda, which is an open-source package management system and environment management system that makes it easy to install, run, and manage packages and dependencies.

You can download and install Conda from the official website: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Once Conda is installed, create a new environment with the required dependencies using the following command:

`conda create --name <environment-name>`

This will create a new conda environment.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:


`git clone https://github.com/MiggyJ/AI-Case-Studies.git`


Activate the Conda environment by running the following command:

`conda activate <environment-name>`


Then navigate to the folder of your interest and run the scripts to reproduce the results.
